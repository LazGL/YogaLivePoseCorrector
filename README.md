# Personal Yoga Coach (On-Device AI)

Personal Yoga Coach is a cutting-edge, AI-powered application designed to provide personalized yoga guidance directly on your device. The app enhances your yoga practice by offering real-time feedback, customized routines, and on-demand coaching‚Äîall while operating entirely offline to ensure privacy and accessibility.

This project won the **Meta Consumer AI on the Edge Hackathon in December 2024**. Huge thanks to the **Lightning-Fast Teammates** for making this possible: **Gaspard Hassenforder, Alex Bohane, Lazlo Guioland, Julien Roubaud, and Alba Maria Tellez Fernandez**.

## üåü Features

- **üñ•Ô∏è On-Device AI**: Runs offline using Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct for local LLM inference, ensuring privacy and no dependency on the internet.
- **üßò Real-Time Feedback**: AI-powered pose correction and accuracy scoring to help improve posture and technique.
- **üó£Ô∏è Voice and Visual Guidance**: Provides both verbal cues and on-screen visual overlays for pose corrections.
- **ü¶æ Computer Vision-Powered Analysis**: Uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** for real-time human pose detection and skeleton tracking.
- **üéôÔ∏è AI-Driven Voice Feedback**: NLP-driven corrections via **Qwen LLM**, using structured prompt engineering for precise feedback. Integrated with **Piper TTS** for voice-based corrections.
- **üìä Adaptive Feedback Mechanism**: Scores pose accuracy and dynamically adjusts the difficulty level and feedback precision based on user performance.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Gradio UI for User Interaction**: Browser-based interactive interface that provides real-time visualization of detected poses and feedback.
- **‚ö° Optimized Performance**: Implements multi-threaded pose analysis, caching mechanisms, and lightweight inference models for seamless execution on local devices.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Pose Detection**:
   - Utilizes **MediaPipe's BlazePose** for extracting human body key points.
   - Processes the skeletal structure using **OpenCV** overlays.
   
2. **AI-Powered Correction**:
   - Compares detected poses with predefined yoga posture templates.
   - Uses **Qwen LLM** to provide textual and audio-based corrections.
   
3. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Processes corrections dynamically and offers **voice guidance via Piper TTS**.
   - Displays **visual cues on Gradio UI** for better understanding.
   
4. **Adaptive Accuracy Scoring**:
   - Computes pose similarity scores using cosine similarity between detected and ideal skeletal points.
   - Adjusts guidance based on user performance over multiple sessions.
