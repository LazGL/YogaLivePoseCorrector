      " |          inputs: List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.\n",
      " |          outputs: List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.\n",
      " |          api_name: defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the API docs with the given name. If None (default), the name of the function will be used as the API endpoint. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the API docs and downstream apps (including those that `gr.load` this app) will not be able to use this event.\n",

      " |          show_progress: how to show the progress animation while event is running: \"full\" shows a spinner which covers the output component area as well as a runtime display in the upper right corner, \"minimal\" only shows the runtime display, \"hidden\" shows no progress animation at all\n",
      " |          queue: If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.\n",
      " |          batch: If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.\n",
      " |          max_batch_size: Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)\n",
      " |          preprocess: If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).\n",
      " |          postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.\n",
      " |          cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.\n",
      " |          trigger_mode: If \"once\" (default for all events except `.change()`) would not allow any submissions while an event is pending. If set to \"multiple\", unlimited submissions are allowed while pending, and \"always_last\" (default for `.change()` and `.key_up()` events) would allow a second submission after the pending event is complete.\n",
      " |          js: Optional frontend js method to run before running 'fn'. Input arguments for js method are values of 'inputs' and 'outputs', return should be a list of values for output components.\n",

Set to \"default\" to use the default concurrency limit (defined by the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter in `Blocks.queue()`, which itself is 1 by default).\n",
      " |          concurrency_id: If set, this is the id of the concurrency group. Events with the same concurrency_id will be limited by the lowest set concurrency_limit.\n",
      " |          show_api: whether to show this event in the \"view API\" page of the Gradio app, or in the \".view_api()\" method of the Gradio clients. Unlike setting api_name to False, setting show_api to False will still allow downstream apps as well as the Clients to use this event. If fn is None, show_api will automatically be set to False.\n",
